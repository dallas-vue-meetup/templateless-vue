1. Intro
  - Hello I'm Tim Waite
  - UI Engineer Dialexa
  - Co-org of the Meetup
  - Today I will be talking about Templateless Vue, which is just a fancy way of saying JSX/Render

2. "I don't want to use Vue because I don't like templates" - A React Dev
  - No templates required
  - Vue doesn't need templates, you can use Render functions (they're ugly)
  - The alternative is JSX
  - If you haven't heard of that, we'll discuss it in a second
  - JSX comes out of the box
  - Templates aren't always good (long lists of ifs)

3. What is JSX
  - Javascript and XML/HTML combined
  - Let's you use javascript expressions inside of your template
  - If and For can be used instead of directives
  - Events are prefixed with on
